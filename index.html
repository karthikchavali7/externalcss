  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <h1>External css</h1>
  
  <div class="box">It is one of the most commonly used CSS forms for updating, styling, and modifying the distinctive styles in many HTML web pages at once. An external style sheet can be called into an HTML document using two methods: 

    Using the <link> tag in the HTML document head. 
    Using a combination of external CSS functions and integrated CSS. 
    One of the unique features of external CSS is that we can write an external style sheet in any text editor, but it should always be saved with a .css extension, and the file must not contain any HTML elements.
    We use the external style sheet when we wish to make modifications to numerous pages. Using external CSS is excellent for this situation because it allows us to modify the look of the complete website with only one file modification.

It is instrumental when working on big projects or multiple HTML web pages.

To implement external CSS we have to define the filename of the CSS sheet with “mystyle.css” extension within the <link> element inside the <head> section of the HTML page:
    
    </div>
</body>
</html>
